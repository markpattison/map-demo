# map-demo
This project is part of the [F# Advent Calendar in English 2020](https://sergeytihon.com/2020/10/22/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2020/).

In this walkthrough I'll show how to quickly and easily visualise data on an interactive map using [F#](https://fsharp.org/), [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and the [SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/).

See it in action at http://www.markpattison.net/mapdemo/

## Install pre-requisites
You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* The [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) 3.1 or higher.
* [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) package manager.
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Starting the application
Before you run the project **for the first time only** you must install dotnet "local tools" with this command:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
```

To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
dotnet fake build -t run
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
